# About this project

- I've done this project while learning PHP on Laracast.
- This project has helped me building my PHP basics very clearly, and motive behind this is to learn laravel in depth in next project.
- Main topics cleared in this project are as below:
    - PDO
    - Service Containers
    - Middleware
    - Sessions
    - Authentication and Authorisation
    - Composer
    - Refactoring techniques
    - Router->Controllers->Views
    - Used free tailwind HTML & CSS templates which saved alot of time for designing a new tamplates.

- Above topics helped me building imaginary mapping while building an web application while following good conventions as well as code refactoring.
